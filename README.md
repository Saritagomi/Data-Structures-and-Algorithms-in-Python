# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to exploring Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. This repository is designed as a comprehensive educational resource for students, enthusiasts, and professionals who wish to deepen their understanding of DSA and enhance their problem-solving skills using Python.

## Repository Overview

In this repository, you'll find Python implementations of various data structures and algorithms, crafted to help you grasp the fundamentals and advanced concepts in a structured manner. Each module is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to make the concepts as clear and accessible as possible.

## Features

- **Data Structures:** Learn about basic and advanced data structures such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Trees, Graphs, and more. Each data structure is implemented with illustrative Python code.
- **Algorithms:** Explore sorting algorithms (like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort), searching algorithms (like Linear Search, Binary Search), and more complex algorithms like Dynamic Programming and Greedy Techniques.
- **Interactive Examples:** Each topic includes practical examples and problem sets that you can run and modify to see the data structures and algorithms in action.
- **Problem Solving Patterns:** Understand common patterns and techniques used in competitive programming and technical interviews.
- **Tests and Benchmarks:** Contains tests to validate your code and benchmarks to understand the efficiency of different approaches.

## Tools Used

- **Python:** All code is written in Python due to its readability and wide usage in education and professional settings.
- **pytest:** For running unit tests to ensure code reliability and correctness.

## Getting Started
